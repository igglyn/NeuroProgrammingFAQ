<p>The Programming chat, despite it's name is the general tech channel.<br />
The channel description sums it up best; But another word phrase is:<br />
If your called a nerd or need the help of nerds. You are in the correct place.</p>

<tr>
<td>- Voice</td>
<td>Whisper for vocal transcribing other people's voices</td>
<td>For Vocal input, you can grab an LLM with audio input (source)</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>??? for TTS, Applio for RVC, search for RVC voices on a site like silly tavern</td>
<td>No way that I'm aware of to train such.</td>

<td>For Vocal output, some LLMs do such but still need an RVC step. Applio is what is recommended for such.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>- LLM</td>
<td><strong>TODO!</strong> Ask around for rec based on VRAM, maybe 6GB, 12GB, 24GB</td>
<td><strong>TODO!</strong> Same as left, but some finetuning advice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>CPU (step 1 is getting a GPU)</td>
<td>Unless you rent out a H100 cluster, TBs of raw data AND can outskill entire teams of AI research. Then finetune a model.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>- Vision</td>
<td><strong>TODO!</strong> Ask on this one</td>
<td><strong>TODO!</strong> Ask on this side as well</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>Some object detection is possible to train sepratly, Better off grabbing an existing object detection model.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>having your LLM include vision is also an option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>- Memory</td>
<td><strong>TODO!</strong> Best we got is some sort of RAG.</td>
<td>Intergrate some flavor of RAG into your LLM model. However you do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Maybe memgpt or similar, I got no idea on this one.</td>
<td>Long term, some database for memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>- API</td>
<td><strong>TODO!</strong> You really, really think this just exists? xdx</td>
<td>Not an AI question; check if a general project exists or hit the docs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>- All of it</td>
<td>N <img alt="NeurOmegalul" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1097297318119743638.webp?size=240" /></td>
